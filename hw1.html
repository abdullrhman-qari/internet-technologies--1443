<h1><b> JavaScript </b></h1> 
<p><big><strong> Introduction:    </strong></big></p>
<p> often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
 alongside HTML and CSS.
  Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,
  often incorporating third-party libraries.
  All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
<p><big><strong> History:    </strong></big></p>
<p>Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape.
 On the JavaScript front,
 Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own,
 called JScript.[20]

JScript was first released in 1996,
 alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. 
 Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator.
  These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers,
 leading to widespread use of "best viewed in Netscape" and "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.</p>
<p><big><strong>The rise of JScript:</strong></big></p>
<p>In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.

The standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.

Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%. This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.

Microsoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.</p>
